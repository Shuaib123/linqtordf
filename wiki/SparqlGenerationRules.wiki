#summary Rules for building SPARQL queries out of LINQ queries.
== Introduction ==

This covers the syntactic process of representing the same query in SPARQL as is represented in a LINQ query, but also rules for generating identifiers, URIs, FILTERs, UNIONs and other aspects of well-formed RDF.


==LINQ Query Examples==

The following is a list of possible LINQ queries. Each is followed by a sample of the SPARQL that should be generated by LINQ to RDF.

  # Select all
{{{
IRdfQuery<Track> qry = new RDF(ts).ForType<Track>(); 
var q = from t in qry
	select new t;
}}}
  # Select with simple clause
{{{
IRdfQuery<Track> qry = new RDF(ts).ForType<Track>(); 
var q = from t in qry
	where t.Year == 2006
	select new t;
}}}
  # Select 
{{{
IRdfQuery<Track> qry = new RDF(ts).ForType<Track>(); 
var q = from t in qry
	where t.Year == 2006 &&
	t.GenreName == "History 5 | Fall 2006 | UC Berkeley" 
	select new t;
}}}
  # Select 
{{{
IRdfQuery<Track> qry = new RDF(ts).ForType<Track>(); 
var q = from t in qry
	where t.Year == 2006 ||
	t.GenreName == "History 5 | Fall 2006 | UC Berkeley" 
	select new t;
}}}
  # Select 
{{{
IRdfQuery<Track> qry = new RDF(ts).ForType<Track>(); 
var q = from t in qry
	where (t.Year == 2006 &&
	t.GenreName == "History 5 | Fall 2006 | UC Berkeley") ||
	(t.ArtistName == "Rory Blythe" && t.Year == 2007)
	select new t;
}}}
